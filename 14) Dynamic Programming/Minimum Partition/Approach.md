Given an array arr of size n containing non-negative integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum and find the minimum difference

<h4>Example 1:</h4>

Input: N = 4, arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5} 
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12 
Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11 

<h4>Approach</h4>
In this Question we make two sets or assume two container.
For every item we have two choice - put into first set or second set.
